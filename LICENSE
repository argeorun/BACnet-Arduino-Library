BACnet for Arduino Library - Dual License

This library consists of two main components with different licenses:

================================================================================
1. ARDUINO WRAPPER CODE (MIT License)
================================================================================

The Arduino wrapper code (all files in the root directory and src/ directory
EXCEPT src/bacnet/) is licensed under the MIT License:

MIT License

LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,
OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE
SOFTWARE.

================================================================================
2. BACNET-STACK CODE (GNU General Public License v2 or later with exception)
================================================================================

The BACnet protocol stack code (all files in src/bacnet/) is derived from
bacnet-stack (https://github.com/bacnet-stack/bacnet-stack) and is licensed
under the GNU General Public License version 2 or any later version with a
special exception for linking:

Copyright (C) 2012 Steve Karg <skarg@users.sourceforge.net>
Copyright (C) by the individual contributors listed in src/bacnet/ files

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the

along with this program; if not, write to:

Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA.

As a special exception, if other files instantiate templates or
use macros or inline functions from this file, or you compile
this file and link it with other works to produce a work based
on this file, this file does not by itself cause the resulting
work to be covered by the GNU General Public License. However
the source code for this file must still be made available in
accordance with section (3) of the GNU General Public License.

This exception does not invalidate any other reasons why a work
based on this file might be covered by the GNU General Public
License.

================================================================================
LINKING EXCEPTION CLARIFICATION
================================================================================

The linking exception for the bacnet-stack code means:

1. You CAN link proprietary/closed-source Arduino code with this library
2. You MUST make the bacnet-stack source code (src/bacnet/) available
3. You do NOT need to release your Arduino wrapper usage code under GPL
4. Modifications to src/bacnet/ files must be released under GPL v2+

This makes the library suitable for both open-source and commercial Arduino
projects while ensuring the BACnet protocol stack remains open.
